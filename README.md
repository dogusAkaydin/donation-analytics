## Challenge Description:
A series of donation records stream in. Each record lists some information about the donor, the recipient and the donation. 
As each record comes in, if the donor is a repeat donor emit a record in the following pipe-delimited format:

    Recipient ID|Zip Code|Donation Year|x-Percentile Donation Amount|Total Amount of Repeat Donations|Number of Repeat Donations|
